## About

JPokeBattle is a Java implementation of the classic Pok√©mon battle system. It features custom Pok√©mon names, evolution mechanics, turn-based battles, and a save system.

## Getting Started

### Playing the Game

If you just want to play the game on Windows without worrying about dependencies:

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/mivige/JPokeBattle/releases) section on GitHub
2. Download the latest `.exe` file
3. Run the executable - no Java installation required (the executable includes a packaged JVM created with jpackage)

### Using the JAR File

If you prefer to use the JAR file (works on any platform with Java installed):

1. Download the JPokeBattle.jar file
2. Run it with: java -jar JPokeBattle.jar

### Building from Source

If you want to build the project yourself:

```
git clone https://github.com/mivige/JPokeBattle.git
cd JPokeBattle
javac src/JPokeBattle.java
java -cp src JPokeBattle
```

## Features

- Turn-based battle system similar to the original Pok√©mon games
- Custom Pok√©mon with Italian-inspired names
- Evolution system
- Experience and leveling mechanics

## Premade Save File

The included pokebattle_save.dat contains:
